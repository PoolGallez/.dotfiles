# Dotfiles
Repo containing my dotfiles.
## Dependencies
* Text editor: neovim -> nvim 
	* Plugin manager: vim-plug. From the settings it is clear that the plugged folder is needed to store the plugins 
* Window manager: BSPWM (Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager)
* Shortcut deamon: SXHKD (Simple X HotKey Deamon) -> still on Xorg :(

This is a starting point, hopefully i will extend it when i am ready with polybar, rofi, etc...
